# Instruction

## Read and understand the code, the logic behind it, the limitation of it
* Answer the question 1 - 4 below (you can edit this file directly)
* Change the code such that it will sort from larger to smaller, put the revision of your code below
* Change the code such that there is no flag variable, put the commit number below and answer question 5 


## Revision, put your commit number here
* Sort from larger to smaller:
* Without flag:

## Questions
1. How this code can sort number from smaller to larger
 
Answer: checking each of 2 number in { 4, 5, 2, 8, 9, 1, 2, 4, 3, 1 } with the while loop sample the left number>right
number the pair of number will be swap!!

Answer: the same number will be side the another such as (4 4 3 2 2 1 1)

3. How many times at line 24 will be executed (as a function of the size of input) 

Answer: 27 times

4. Why we need flag variable ? 

Answer: for repeat the process until the array will sort completely 

5. When we remove the flag variable, the code will run faster or slower? in which scenario? 

Answer:faster!! but it's not complete the purpose (the sort number)
